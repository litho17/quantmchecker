/**
 * <p>
 * A data model for holding genealogical data. Objects are created and populated by classes in the org.gedcom4j.parser
 * package, and written to files using classes in the org.gedcom4j.writer package.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are a large number of { java.util.List} member structures in the data model. These can either be
 * automatically initialized on instantiation with empty { java.util.ArrayList}s, or left null. The former lets you
 * avoid tedious if-null checks in your code, at the expense of memory (there are a lot of empty lists in most cases).
 * The latter saves memory by not allocating ArrayLists for the list structures, but require you to do null-checking
 * before access.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To make this last bit easier, the getters for the List members are overloaded. The normal, no-argument getter simply
 * returns what the backing property refers to - could be an ArrayList, could be null. The overloaded getter takes a
 * boolean parameter, and if true, will initialize the list to an empty ArrayList if it is null before returning the
 * value from the getter. If false, it works exactly the same as the basic no-argument getter.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To control whether lists will be pre-initialized and allocated or not, use the
 * { org.gedcom4j.Options#setCollectionInitializationEnabled(boolean)} property. Note that this property is not
 * final or thread-safe, so if manipulated during a parse/load operation, strange things could happen.
