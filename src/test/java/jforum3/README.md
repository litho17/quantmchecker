JForum
============

*jforum is a powerful and robust discussion board system implemented in Java*

***Disclaimer: I am not actively working on the code anymore, as I moved to another projects and priorities over the years. I keep it here for historical reasons and because it may be useful to someone. This v3 was intented to be a next gen of v2, a total rewrite with new features and approaches. However, interest on the project dismissed over time, and I saw no reason to keep working on it.***


To build jforum just run `mvn package`

You can find database initialization scripts in `src/main/resources/jforumConfig/database` folder.
