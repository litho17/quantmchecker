/**
 * This class helps determine the minimum number of crews a set of flights will need.
 * It will do so by mapping flights to sets of complementary flights. A flight is complementary
 * to another flight if the crew of the first flight can be used by the second flight.
 * <p/>
 * For example:
 * <p/>
 * Flight A from SFO to LAX needs 4 crew members. Flight B from LAX to BWI
 * also needs 4 crew members. Flight B should be able to use the same crew as
 * flight A once flight A arrives at LAX. This is true because flight A and B
 * need the same number of crew members and flight A's destination is flight B's
 * origin.
 * <p/>
 * Flight A is considered complementary to flight B.
 * <p/>
 * Note that flights do not currently include times.  For the purpose of this application,
 * we assume flights are input according to their order of occurance, and that one lands before
 * the next takes off.
