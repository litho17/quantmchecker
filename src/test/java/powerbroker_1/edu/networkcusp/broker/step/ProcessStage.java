/**
 * Phase Class that acts like a latch that waits until all connections
 * have completed (in ConnectionPhase) before moving to the next phase.
 * This class and ConnectionPhase are coupled because connection start
 * requests complete at different times for different connections.
 * As a result, the message sent by this Phase when it starts might be
 * received by another connection before that one has completed its
 * ConnectionPhase.
 * <p>
 * For example, consider two connections A and B.
 * According to ConnectionPhase, A will establish a connection with B
 * and will then write a connection message to B.  However, before
 * the connection message is sent to B, the following steps will happen:
 * <ol>
 * <li>B receives the new connection signal</li>
 * <li>B writes a connection message to A</li>
 * <li>A receives the connection message.  Since it is the only
 * message it needs to receive, A transitions to ProcessPhase</li>
 * <li>A enters ProcessPhase and sends a process start message to B</li>
 * </ol>
 * But B is still in ConnectionPhase waiting for A to write its
 * connection message to B!  For this reason, ConnectionPhase needs to
 * know about ProcessPhase so it can forward the message.  When A
 * finally writes a connection message to B, B will process the message
 * and transition to its next phase.  If ProcessPhase was set as the
 * next phase, it would enter that phase and simply block because it
 * would not receive any more process start messages.  For this reason,
 * ConnectionPhase, when it is ready to transition, asks ProcessPhase
 * to determine the next phase. The decision will be based on whether
 * ProcessPhase has received thenecessary number of messages or not.
 * If ProcessPhase has received enough process start messages, it can
 * be skipped but must still call its enterPhase method so it notifies
 * its connections with a process start message.
 * <p>
 * This coupling is only needed between this phase and ConnectionPhase
 * because new connection requests happen in a different thread than
 * all other phase messages.
